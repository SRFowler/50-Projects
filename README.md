# 50 Front End Projects

This repo covers 50 front end projects done for practice. 
Each project has it's own branch with `00 - Project Starter` in main being the blank scaffolding from which all other projects are built. 
The project starter contains the following files.
    - `index.html` - Simple HTML file that contains all of the required header data for an HTML5 page allong with references to the included style and script files.
    - `script.js` - An empty javascript file to be added to and used where necessary
    - `style.css` - A stylesheet that includes a reference to Google Fonts, a simple reset for all document elements that sets border sizing to border-box to ensure predictible and consistant sizing, and sets a few defaults for body that will be changed as needed between projects.
